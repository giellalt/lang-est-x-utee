# typos.txt
# This file contains common typos and their corrections separated by
# a <tab> character, optionally followed by a comment. That is, the
# format is: three columns, separated by TAB:
#
# Column 1: error word/typo
# Column 2: correction
# Column 3: Comment, starting with # or !
#
# Example:
#
# leif	feil	# This is just an example
#
# Corrections that consist of two or more parts are not split
# further in the preprocessor, because there is no way of knowing
# whether the token is a multipart expression or not.
# Beware of removing sentence delimiters (.!?) in correction, since
# they may indicate sentence boundaries.
#
# Word pairs come from two sources:
# -------------------
# Test and development corpus used for the speller suggestion module by Filosoft in 1990ies.
# 1000 words
# -------------------
# Author: Heiki-Jaan Kaalep 1998
# Typos collected by Heili Orav and Leho Paldre from: 
#    • CELL (Corpus of Estonian Literary Language) http://www.cl.ut.ee. It contains 1 million words from 1983-1988. 
#    • BNS news - texts from a news agency, Baltic News Service, from one month in 1996 (about 250,000 words).
# The errors were gathered by running our Estonian morphological analyzer on the corpus; and then manually picking misspellings from the set of unanalyzed words.

# These spelling error pairs have been collected in a pretty ad-hoc manner from
# a newspaper corpus.
