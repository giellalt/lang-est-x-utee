Re-convert Filosoft's Vabamorf lexicon into GT infra

Use with care!
(if you want to incorporate some changes made in the Vabamorf lexicon, or make big changes in how the files are built) 

Source: https://github.com/Filosoft/vabamorf

Lexicon files originate from:

https://github.com/Filosoft/vabamorf/tree/master/dct/data/mrf/fs_lex
https://github.com/Filosoft/vabamorf/tree/master/dct/data/mrf/fs_suf

Run the following scripts in this directory to overwrite the .lexc files in ../fst/morphology/stems
(plus one or two .xfscript files in ../fst/filters) 
NB! This will NOT result in replacing all .lexc files; some .lexc files come from other sources.
 
./fs_lex2gt.sh; ./fsgt2final.sh; ./fs_lex2pluraletantum.sh

--------------------
fs_lex2gt.sh

Converts entries of Vabamorf lexicon into LEXC-type entries
1. Convert original inflectional type classification.  
2. Convert original stems into surface and lexical side representation.

--------------------
fsgt2final.sh

Creates .lexc files
1. Create a name for a lexicon, and create a name for a continuation class sublexicon.  
2. Copy every word to a proper (sub)lexicon. This involves classifying the word, based on some tag in the original Vabamorf lexicon, or some phonological pattern of the word itself. 
3. Add flag diacritics to some words.
Both sublexicons and flag diacritics are designed to restrict word compunding. A general rule of compounding relies on word class (noun, adverb etc.), but in order to have finer restrictions, one must divide words into sub-lexicons, or add flag diacritics to individual words.

4. Add weights to lexicons. The weight of a lemma is based on its frequency rank in a frequency dictionary. The most frequent words have rank 0. 

5. Create a filter for eliminating words from a normative speller lexicon. 

--------------------
fs_suf2gt.sh

(called by fsgt2final.sh)
Creates final_components.lexc. This file contains continuation classes, each containing a few words that participate in compound forming more freely than other words.

--------------------
classify_names.sh

(called by fsgt2final.sh)
Groups proper names into geo, persons and other, thus passing the info from Vabamorf lexicon to propernouns.lexc. 

--------------------
fs_lex2pluraletantum.sh
Create a filter for removing singular wordforms of plurale tantum words. This filter is applied while constructing a simplex word Estonian transducer.
IF you want to use this filter in the transducer building process, you have to copy it yourselt to ../fst/filters
