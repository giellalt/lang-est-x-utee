!!!fst

!!Compounding

__Lexicalised compounds__ 

Jaak has included the compounds needed by Oahpa into the fst. Generation of forms of these lexicalised compounds works fine for Oahpa now.

Problem: if we want to use the same lexicon for the hyphenation then we need the hash mark as the separator of the parts of the compounds.

Example of a lexicalised compound in other languages:
word1word2:word1#word2 CONTLEX ;
Exceptional hyphenation points:
lemma:ste^m CONTLEX ;

__Dynamic compounds__

Done by fst concatenation + filters to weed out overgeneration in Estonian. The system of filters is complex.

!!Problem with some illative forms

Some illative forms do not generate, e.g.
{{{
mees+N+Sg+Ill	+? 
}}}

This has happened as a result of suppressing some short illative (previously tagged as additive) forms, e.g. {{mees:*mehhe}}. Now {{mehesse}} does not generate either.

!!!CG

Tiina has added the Estonian-specific scripts that include lists of pronouns, intransitive and partitive verbs etc.

!!!To do before the meeting on 19.-21.01.

__Heiki__: describe the results of the comparison of Estonian and Finnish tags. Article on a linguistically motivated tag system. Multilingual, broader view? Discuss with Tommi Pirinen and "the Saami people" in Troms√∏.

__Jaak__: check the illative forms (some are missing now) and ja- and mine-forms

__Heli__: Make Oahpa Morfa-S with full coverage of the "E nagu Eesti" dictionary available online (generate a new database).

__Tiina__: make further steps towards an Estonian CG that is working in gt infrastructure.

__Heiki, Heli, Trond__: Put together an agenda of the physical meeting and e-mail it to all the participants.

One topic for discussion: preprocess and determination of sentence boundaries (and clause boundaries) for Estonian. Compare EstNLTK (Python) with Giellatekno tools.
